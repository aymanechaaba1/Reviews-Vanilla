\*\* Reviews App using Vanilla JS

A cool reviews project, you can a review, sort and filter reviews.

Checkout src/script.js file to see the magic behind this cool app.

I enjoyed building this app a lot because I love everything about eCommerce websites.
I'm planning on building more components that make the entire e-Commerce website functional.
And I'm planning on adding more features that enhance the user experience of an e-Commerce website.

I'm not using any backend, so no data is persistent. I will add firebase firestore and why not firebase auth to make the website even more real-world.
